Key insights:

Gender & Income: Male customers generate slightly higher income ($15.2M vs $13.7M for females), though both segments show strong purchasing power with females having a higher "Yes" conversion rate.

Age Demographics: Older customers show significantly higher purchase rates than middle-aged ones. The "Yes" line (orange) trends upward with age, suggesting older demographics are more likely to buy bikes.

Commute Distance: There's a clear sweet spot for bike purchases. The lowest purchase rates occur at 2-5 mile commute distances, while very short commutes (0-1 miles) and longer distances (10+ miles) show higher conversion rates. This suggests bikes appeal to both convenience shoppers for short trips and dedicated cyclists for longer commutes.

Key Takeaway: The business should focus marketing efforts on older demographics and customers with either very short or very long commutes, while investigating why the 2-5 mile segment has lower conversion rates - this could represent an untapped opportunity.
